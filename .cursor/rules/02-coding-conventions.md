- Prefer guard clauses and early returns; avoid deep nesting.
- Avoid trivial try/catch; only catch with meaningful handling.
- Write readable, self-documenting code with descriptive names (no 1?2 letter vars).
- Keep comments minimal and only for non-obvious context, invariants, or caveats.
- Match existing formatting; don?t reformat unrelated code.
