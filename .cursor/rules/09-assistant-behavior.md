- Before edits: search broadly, then read only the most relevant files.
- When adding code: include imports and keep code runnable. If adding dependencies, use version catalog aliases.
- Prefer minimal diffs; don?t reformat large files.
- When you say you?re about to do an action, do it in the same turn.
